# Dota Match Analyzer
Dota 2 is a game that I've invested a lot of time in, and have enjoyed for years. The data from every game I've played can and has been parsed for this project.  
This started as my Cogs 109 (Data Visualization) project. I hope to clean it up more and explore further.  
I was set back because the sources I was using that had detailed info about how to use their API was taken down.
