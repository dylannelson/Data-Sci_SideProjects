# Data-Sci_SideProjects
This is just a small, growing collection of Data Science projects I've done. 
### Dota Project
Dota 2, a popular online game I play, has an API I use to analyze the matches I play  
### Fire Project  
Using the Cal-Fire public datasets, I'm trying to clean and observe what's been happening to California, and why almost nothing *seemed* to have burned in 2019  
### xkcd Data  
There is an xkcd API that allowed me to collect all the availible data from each comic, and keep a record of it in case they ever go down  
I soon plan to automate downloading new comics  
### Folding at Home  
Folding at home is program that allows people to contribute their GPU and CPU power to analyzing diseases. This tracks my usage of the program, and compares it to other users at my school
